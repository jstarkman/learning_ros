# using_a_ros_library

This package illustrates how to link an executable to a custom ROS library.  The example is identical to the class defined in package example_ros_class and in package creating_a_ros_library.  The only difference with this package is that it only contains the
test main program, and it links with the library created in package creating_a_ros_library.

## Example usage

`$ ros_library_external_test_main` starts the test executable.
